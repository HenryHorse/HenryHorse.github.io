        <em>Hi!</em>
        My name is Shayan Daijavad! I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Major at
        <strong>Cal Poly SLO</strong>.

        My interests are reading (my favorite book is The Left Hand of Darkness), playing video games (I like open world RPGs), exercising, cooking, and listening to music (mostly Olivia Rodrigo and Laufey at the moment).
